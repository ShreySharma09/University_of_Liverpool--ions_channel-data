# University_of_Liverpool--Ion Switching data
In this project, the main objective is to predict the number of open_channels present, based on electrophysiological signal data. These predictions are at submicroscopic level.
By studying ion channels, which may be possible with the aid of machine learning, it could have a far-reaching impact on fighting infections, enabling pain signals, and stimulating muscle contraction. Humans must supervise the analysis, which imparts considerable bias, in addition to being tedious. These difficulties limit the volume of ion channel current analysis that can be used in research.
In this project, we use ion channel data to better model automatic identification methods. Achieving this will contribute towards detecting individual ion channel events in noisy raw signals. The data is simulated and injected with real world noise to emulate what scientists observe in laboratory experiments. This research could impact many areas related to cell health and migration. From human diseases to how climate change affects plants, faster detection of ion channels could greatly accelerate solutions to major world problems.
